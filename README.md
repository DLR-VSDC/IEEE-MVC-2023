# IEEE VTS Motor Vehicles Challenge 2023: A Multi-physical Benchmark Problem for Next Generation Energy Management Algorithms

## Introduction

The competitors are invited to develop the energy management algorithm (EMA) for the vehicle (cf. Figure 1).  
The EMA determines the operating conditions for the two energy storage devices and the three electric motors;  
minimization of the energy consumption and battery degradation are some  of the main goals of the EMA.

## Annoucment
**Registration is open**. All interested competitor teams are asked [to register for the MVC 2023](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe94R0zzwrVEMW3Cklv1id_CjdjhQdCgGX9MugRUXq23lMYLg/viewform?usp=sf_link).  

### Preliminary timeline
- **Deadline extension:** Registration is open until mid of Jan. 23.
- EMA submission deadline ~ March 23.
- Paper submission deadline - tba.
### Release Notes
Please refer to [the change log](CHANGELOG.md).  
**Latest: 13th of Jan. 23 - Beta 3** (i.a. corrected battery voltage signal).  
**Remarks:** 
- Parameterization is quiet likely in final state. Next release might be final release.  
- Please take notice of our [General Answer to Questions about Modelica Implementation Details](https://github.com/DLR-VSDC/IEEE-MVC-2023/discussions/17)

### THE MVC 2023 Benchmark Problem

In Figure 1 the MVC 2023 challenge model and it's components are shown.  
The competitors are invited to develop the top red block, the energy management algorithm (EMA).
