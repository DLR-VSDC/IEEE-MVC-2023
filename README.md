# IEEE VTS Motor Vehicles Challenge 2023: A Multi-physical Benchmark Problem for Next Generation Energy Management Algorithms

## Introduction

The competitors are invited to develop the energy management algorithm (EMA) for the vehicle (cf. Figure 1).
The EMA determines the operating conditions for the two energy storage devices and the three electric motors; minimization of the energy consumption and battery degradation are some  of the main goals of the EMA.

## Announcement

Dear competitors,

we are happy to announce that the team   
**EDLab Sharks team from University of Padova won this year’s edition of the IEEE VTS Motor Vehicles Challange 2023**.   
2nd place: Ricercatori Polimi TEAM 2 from Politecnico di Milano  
3rd place: NDS strategy 1 from Politecnico di Milano  

Congratulations!

All rankings and details on the assessment process [can be found here](./media/IEEE_MVC2023_Ranking.pdf).

Many thanks to all competitors and their valuable input during the development process of the challenge.
We are looking forward to meet you in person at the IEEE VPPC 2023 in Milan!
