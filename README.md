# IEEE VTS Motor Vehicles Challenge 2023: A Multi-physical Benchmark Problem for Next Generation Energy Management Algorithms

## Introduction

The competitors are invited to develop the energy management algorithm (EMA) for the vehicle (cf. Figure 1).
The EMA determines the operating conditions for the two energy storage devices and the three electric motors; minimization of the energy consumption and battery degradation are some  of the main goals of the EMA.

## Announcement

**Registration is closed** and the repository is in final state.

**Please follow the** [**submission guideline** for your proposed EMA using a private GITHUB repository as described](SUBGUIDE.md).  
Make sure **your EMA model can be executed by the "main.m" script**. This is crucial for the later (partial automated) assessment process of your EMA in the competition. 

Good luck! 

### Timeline

- **EMA submission deadline is 31st of March 2023.**
- [Paper submission deadline - 17th of April 2023.](https://events.vtsociety.org/vppc2023/)

### Release Notes

Please refer to [the change log](CHANGELOG.md).  
**Latest: 17th of Feb. 2023 - Final Release** (i.a. 30&nbsp;s preview horizon).
