# IEEE Motor Vehicles Challenge (MVC) 2023 EMA installation instructions

## Preparations
- Make a local clone of the GIT repository https://github.com/DLR-VSDC/IEEE-MVC-2023.
- To do this, a helpful tool for Windows is e.g. [Tortoise GIT](https://tortoisegit.org/).
- It is required to have **Matlab Version R2021b** (tested) or newer installed.
- We do make use of the open source (2-Clause BSD license) FMI Kit for Simulink from Catia Systems.
For more information on the FMI-Kit please refer to https://github.com/CATIA-Systems/FMIKit-Simulink.
- To install it to your system, simply run the script "FMI_Init.m" in your local repository.

## Setup test
You can run tests with the "baseline EMA policy": To execute the Simulink model, please run the script "Main.m":
- this script will define some parameters of the vehicle system.
- The mission profile will be selected according to the user's choice.
- At the end of the simulation, an autogenerated report will summarize the performance of the EMA.

## Setup your own EMA
- Please insert your EMA replacing the baseline policy (the red block in the Simulink model "testEnergyManagementAlgorithm.slx" - Figure 1).
- To run the Simulink model, run the main script "Main.m" again.
- Evaluate your EMA by checking the generated "Report.html"

Good luck!
