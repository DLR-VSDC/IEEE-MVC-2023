# IEEE VTS Motor Vehicles Challenge 2023: A Multi-physical Benchmark Problem for Next Generation Energy Management Algorithms

Competitors are provided with the following **10 mission profiles** to test their developed EMAs. These tracks divide into the following groups:

### 1. Four Standardized Mission Tracks

The first group of tracks correspond to the standard driving cycles, and are linear motion profiles (with no curvature):

- Track 1: EPA Federal Test Procedure - FTP75     			

- Track 2: European standard driving cycle - ECE15   

- Track 3: European Artemis Urban driving cycle - ArtemisUrban

- Track 4: European Artemis Rural driving cycle - Artemis Rural


### 2. Six DLR-Provided Mission Tracks

The second group of mission tracks correspond to the reference mission profiles that have been recorded and provided by DLR test facilites under different driving conditions.
These tracks contain curvature values as wel as reference speed over the mission profile.

Munich inner-city profiles: optimized or non-optmized tracks.
